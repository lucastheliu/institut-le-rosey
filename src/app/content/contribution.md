## New documented parts

For our project, we documented one new part: [BBa_K5502000](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K5502000).

**BBa_K5502000** is a DNA template/padlock probe for rolling circle amplification specifically for the EGFR 23 bp deletion mutation on exon 19. The 3' and 5' arm of the padlock is complementary to the mutated sequence. It can be used in a rolling circle amplification process with the help of ligation using T4 ligase and replication using phi29 polymerase and random exonuclease-resistant primers. The middle sequence contains the flanking sequence of the left and right lettuce ([BBa_K4245134](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4245134) and [BBa_K4245135](https://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K4245135)), as the rolling circle product will be a binding site for the detection mechanism.

## Troubleshooting

As we are a high school team, most of our members do not have much experience in the lab; therefore, we ran into a lot of unexpected results and problems. Here are some troubleshooting tips for future iGEM teams.

### General

**1. Check the input product.**

As DNA sequences are not visible to the bare eyes, before proceeding with the experiment, the team should check the viability of the input product. There might be times that the problem is not the experiment design itself but rather the ordered DNA sequences that might be exposed to DNases or might have degraded during the shipping process. This is not always the case but sometimes this might happen, which can waste a lot of time in the lab figuring out what went wrong with the experiment.

**2. Have a control trial**

As there can be many things that can go wrong with an experimental design in the first engineering cycle, running a control trial is extremely crucial. The way the control trial behaves throughout the experiment can indicate which part is going wrong in your protocol or design. When our team ran gel electrophoresis, the absence of the control trial indicates that there has to be a wrong step in the gel or the input product itself; therefore, we tested our hypothesis and figured out the problem

**3. Working with small quantities**

When working with extremely small quantities of samples, it is more prone to higher error percentage. Our team found that pipetting countities like 0.1 mcl is extremely difficult and prone to error; therefore, it might be helpful to dilute the concentration and increase the volume of the samples proportionally to produce a more constant result.

#### Gel electrophoresis

**1. Staining of ssDNA**

The most common stain used in gel electrophoresis is SYBR Safe. However, as this stain is designed to bind to dsDNA specifically, it will not work in experiments that are hoping to detect ssDNA. This resulted in a couple of unexpected results during our experiments where no bands were present on the gel despite the fact that there were samples in the well. We switched to using SYBR™ Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain which can bind to ssDNA, dsDNA and RNA. There are also other alternatives such as SYBR™ Green II RNA Gel Stain which is ultrasensitive to ssDNA as well as RNA

**2. Amount of DNA content for best band result**

Our team had to increase the concentration in the ligation protocol in order to detect the ligation product in the gel as stains have different optimum DNA content which will result in the best band result. For example, SYBR™ Safe works best with 20-100 ng of DNA but will still consistently good result with 5-200 ng of DNA; SYBR™ Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain will work best with 98-300 ng of DNA. Increasing or decreasing DNA content can makes the band more visible in the gel which makes it easier to analyze the result

## Education

Our team engaged in many educational activities within our community with the objective to raise awareness about the potential of synthetic biology and draw attention to the iGEM competition. We have been contacted by many students within our school to continue the project and compete in the future in the competition. In addition, we have been contacted by some students from outside the country to answer questions about our starting journey as we are the first high school iGEM team in the school and region.
