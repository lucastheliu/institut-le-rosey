## 24.09.2024 – Wiki Development & RCA with Controls

Continued updating the wiki with the latest project progress.

Ran ligation with controls for EGFR wildtype and mutation; the controls were detected, but the ligated DNA was not, likely due to insufficient DNA concentration.

## 25.09.2024 – RCA Verification with Higher Concentration

Increased DNA concentration for ligation, successfully detecting a small band (~100-150 base pairs), likely the hybridized EGFR mutation padlock.

Detected RCA product in the mutation, confirming that initial failures were due to insufficient DNA quantities.
