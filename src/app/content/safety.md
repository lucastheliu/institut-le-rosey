### Team Safety Guidelines

- **Handwashing:** Hands must be washed upon entering and exiting the laboratory.
- **Protective Measures:** Protect eyes, mucous membranes, and any open cuts or wounds from biohazard materials.
- **Food and Drinks:** Eating or drinking in the laboratory is strictly prohibited.
- **PPE:** Wear gloves and splash-proof goggles at all times.
- **Hair Safety:** Tie back long or loose hair to avoid interference.
- **Surface Disinfection:** Disinfect all surfaces with 70% ethanol before starting work.
- **Waste Disposal:**
  - Soak disposable tips, glassware, and tubes in a 10% bleach solution for 20 minutes before disposal.
  - Discard growth plates in a biohazard container to be autoclaved.
- **Equipment Checks:** Ensure all equipment is functioning properly with no cracks, chips, or damaged cords. Report any issues immediately.
- **Pipetting:** Avoid letting the pipette tip touch the sides of containers.
- **Tube Caps:** Do not place tube caps upside down. Use masking tape to secure items in the cabinet if needed.
- **Post-Work Cleaning:** Clean all work areas with 70% ethanol after finishing work.
- **Storage and Cleanliness:** Clean and store all glassware and equipment properly before leaving the lab.
- **Clear Walkways:** Keep backpacks and stools to the side to ensure clear walkways.
- **Proper Disposal:** Follow appropriate disposal procedures for laboratory materials at all times.

### Project Safety Guidelines

- **PPE:** Standard PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coats) must always be worn.
- **Biosafety Cabinet Use:** Use the biosafety cabinet to handle chemicals such as SYBR GOLD and DFHBI-1T.
- **Surface Decontamination:** Use disposable pipette tips and decontaminate all surfaces with 70% ethanol or a similar disinfectant before and after use.
- **Contamination Awareness:** When handling amplified nucleic acids, use separate pipettes for pre- and post-amplification areas to reduce contamination risk.
- **Material Sterilization:** Autoclave or disinfect all materials that come into contact with amplified DNA or RNA.
- **Electrical Safety:**
  - Ensure the power supply is turned off and disconnected before handling the gel box, buffer solution, or electrophoresis apparatus.
  - Do not touch the buffer or gel while the electrophoresis system is running to avoid electric shock.
- **Pipette Tip Use:** Always use filtered pipette tips to avoid contamination, and change tips between samples.
- **Labeling:** Clearly label all reagents, samples, and gels to avoid confusion or accidental misuse.
- **UV Light Safety:** If using UV light for visualizing nucleic acid bands, wear UV protective goggles or face shields.
- **UV Light Exposure:** Limit UV exposure by turning off the UV transilluminator when not in use.

### Human Practices and Education

All participants in the **Aptagenix** project provided the required consent forms from themselves or their legal guardians. Safety training (FOBS 1+2) was provided by **EPFL University** before the experiments began.
