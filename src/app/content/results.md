## Ligation

Our team ran the first round of ligation reaction to determine the success of our padlock probe in an in vitro reaction. To detect the presence of the hybridized circular DNA we ran gel experimentation with SYBR safe stain, expecting a band at around 101 bp which is the length of our padlock probe.

Additionally, on the gel we ran the control of EGFR mutation and wildtype as well as the padlock probe as the control along with the selected samples.

On our first round of experiment, no bands were being shown on the plate reader except the DNA ladder. Our team concluded that this is because SYBR safe stain is engineered to only detect double stranded DNA and since our DNA is single stranded none of the stain were able to bind to the nucleotides and fluoresce. As a result, on the following experiment we updated our gel protocol to use SYBR™ Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain instead of the SYBR™ safe stain.

On the second round of the experiment, we ran the same set of ligation protocol but with the new gel electrophoresis protocol. This time we detected a small band at less than 100 bp in the control wells, meaning the SYBR Gold stain successfully binds to the single-stranded EGFR sequences. However, there is nothing present in the sample wells. We hypothesized that this is due to the insufficient quantity of DNA materials; therefore, not enough SYBR Gold molecules were able to bind and produces fluorescence.

On the third round of the experiment, we ran the ligation protocol however, we used 10 mcM of EGFR instead of 1 mcM and 400 nM of padlock probe instead of 100 nM. This is to increase the DNA material in the wells; therefore, it can be visible on the gel as a proof for success of the ligation process. As a result, we detected a line of fluorescent nucleotides on the line of the sample wells; however, no clear band was present. We concluded that this might be due to the circular shape of the hybrized DNA which can be folded in different way resulting in different distances on the gel as open circular DNA will create more friction than linear DNA while supercoiled circular DNA will have less friction than linear DNA. This proves that ligation was a success.

## Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA)

Our team ran the first round of RCA to determine the success of our padlock probe design in an in vitro reaction. To detect the presence of rolling circle product (RCP), we ran gel experimentation with SYBR safe stain, expecting a band at around >1 kbp which represents a large DNA produced by the reaction

On our first round of experiment, no bands were being shown on the plate reader except the DNA ladder. Our team concluded that this is because SYBR safe stain is engineered to only detect double stranded DNA and since our DNA is single stranded none of the stain were able to bind to the nucleotides and fluoresce. As a result, on the following experiment we updated our gel protocol to use SYBR™ Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain instead of the SYBR™ safe stain.

On the second round of the experiment, after the running the gel for the ligation process, we tested out the hypothesis that the absence of a band in the gel is due to the insufficient quantity of DNA material by continuing to run RCA on the same sample with the assumption that if the ligation was a success, there should be RCP present in these samples. After running the gel, the presence of the RCP is detected in the samples ran with EGFR mutation as it shows bands at > 1kbp, while nothing was detected in the samples ran with the EGFR wildtype. This proves the success of the RCA protocols.
