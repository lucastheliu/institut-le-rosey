### Ethics Debate

To raise awareness on the ethics and issues of synthetic biology in practice, we collaborated with Le Rosey’s debating society to have a debate with the motion; ‘This House Believes that synthetic biology in practice is unethical.’ It was staged as a prepared debate; the speakers had an hour to prepare with the ability to use technology and books to research their topic – relying on their prior knowledge and ability to form arguments.

Le Rosey’s licensed debate coach worked with us and supervised the debate, judging the students and ranking their arguments and structure of their speeches. The debate was held on the 2nd of October – teaching the audience and members of the debate society the dangers, ethics, and ideas behind synthetic biology.

To raise awareness about lung cancer in our community, we created merchandise that promotes IGEM and synthetic biology. Some designs include messages and useful information about the impact of cancer, showing support for those affected by the disease. We sold over 100 items, helping to raise funds for our project and spread awareness about lung cancer.

### Elementary School Workshop

We recently had the opportunity to introduce the basics of DNA to a group of junior students aged 10-11. We focused on fundamental concepts such as:

- Nature of DNA
- DNA structure
- Fundamentals of synthetic biology
- The potential of synthetic biology

During the session, we encouraged students to ask questions and actively engage by providing printouts for each of the bases and asking them to pair them individually. Each concept was explained in detail, and we made sure to address all their questions.

It was a pleasure to see so many students express curiosity and interest in the basics of synthetic biology.

**Observations:**

- Some students struggled to understand that everything we are made of is composed of DNA, and that the different combinations of bases cause the differences.
- Occasionally, they mixed up the base pairs.
- The hydrogen bonds were a bit confusing, as they had no background in chemistry.

### Educational announcement

Every week, we presented our iGEM project to our school community, aiming to raise awareness about lung cancer, a disease that often goes undiagnosed until its later stages. We highlighted the challenges of early detection, such as the difficulty of spotting early-stage tumors and the invasiveness of current diagnostic methods.

By educating our peers, we emphasized the need for innovative, less invasive solutions, like the synthetic biology tools we are developing, to improve early detection. Our goal has been to engage the community, inspire scientific interest, and demonstrate the potential of synthetic biology in addressing critical health issues.
